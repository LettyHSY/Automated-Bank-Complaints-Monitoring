### Automated-Bank-Complaints-Monitoring
#### Project Goal
There are different categories of complaints for each bank, and it's tedious for employees in the customer service department to mannually detect the customers who leave the most urgent and severe complaints and are needed to compensate with money. Thus, the project purpose is to automate the business process of detecting urgent bank complaint narratives that require monetary compensation to prevent customer churn more effectively. This project mainly focuses on two product lines of credit card and bank account.
#### Data Information
Data description: Each record contains the information of the complaint narrative for some specific product/service at some specific bank on some specific date and what kind of response the company gave.
